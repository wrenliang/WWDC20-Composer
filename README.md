# WWDC20 Submission: Composer

## What is Composer?
My Swift Playground is a beginner-friendly introduction to music composition. I recorded myself playing the viola and used the sound samples in order to make this interactive experience. The goal was to create an accessible, unintimidating way to start creating music without any prior experience or theory knowledge.

Playing viola has enriched my life by giving me an emotional outlet, allowing me to express my creativity, and helping bring joy to others. My goal for this Playground was to share these positive experiences with people, regardless of their prior musical experience. Especially in times like these, I find having a form of mental escapism quite valuable, so I wanted to use technology to emulate that feeling for others.
