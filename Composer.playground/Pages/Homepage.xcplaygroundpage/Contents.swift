 ## About me
 Making music has been a significant aspect of my life for as long as I can remember. I started playing violin from the age of 5, and although the decision to learn an instrument was imposed on me then, as I have developed and matured, I have grown to appreciate that decision and to love music.
 
 My name is Wren Liang and I am from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I am 19 years old and I study Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. When Iâ€™m not programming or studying, you can find me playing violin, viola and guitar, or snowboarding and hiking in the Rockies.

 ## What is Composer?
 My Swift Playground is a beginner-friendly introduction to music composition. I recorded myself playing the viola and used the sound samples in order to make this interactive experience. The goal was to create an accessible, unintimidating way to start creating music without any prior experience or theory knowledge.
 
 Playing viola has enriched my life by giving me an emotional outlet, allowing me to express my creativity, and helping bring joy to others. My goal for this Playground was to share these positive experiences with people, regardless of their prior musical experience. Especially in times like these, I find having a form of mental escapism quite valuable, so I wanted to use technology to emulate that feeling for others.
